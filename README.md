## 1. Rock vs Mine Prediction
This model is developed to classify underwater sonar signals as either rocks or mines. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the patterns in the sonar data, enabling accurate prediction of the object type. The model uses Logistic Regression algorithm. The dataset for this project is available in the data folder.
## 2. Diabetes Prediction
The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning model designed to predict an individual's likelihood of diabetes based on their medical and demographic information. By analyzing relevant features and patterns in the data, the system can assist in identifying individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes. The model uses support vector machines (SVM) algorithm. The dataset for this project is available in the data folder.
## 3. House Price Prediction
The House Price Prediction system offers a tool for estimating house prices based on their features. By leveraging machine learning techniques it aims to provide accurate predictions and support decision-making in the real estate industry. It uses the California housing dataset and XGBoost Regressor algorithm.
